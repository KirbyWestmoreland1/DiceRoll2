# DiceRoller App (Improved)

## Overview
This app simulates rolling dice. It was built in Kotlin and XML based on the tutorial series provided in the assignment.

## Baseline Features
- Roll button generates a random dice result (drawables)
- Dice image updates to match the roll

## My Enhancement
I choose to go with my very own custom colored UI for the app and my very own icons and I also added a Roll History as well to keep track of previous rolled scores.

## How to Run
1. Download the APK from the submission
2. Install it on any Android device/emulator running Android 16.0 or higher
